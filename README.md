# Project Title and purpose

The horses race against eachother and there in a winner. It returns the horse that wins. Each time it is random.

### Difficulties or opportunities you encountered along the way.

I couldn't figure out how to do key press. It doesn't take a bet or anything but it is fine. Also, I am not an artist so the horses are gray blobs.

### Most interesting piece of your code and explanation for what it does.
double num2=Math.random()*2;
        if (num2>1)
        {
          x2+=5;
          this.horseShape(x2,y2);
        }

This is the code that moves the horses. This is just for one. It calls the method that draws and positions the horses to animate them across the screen.
